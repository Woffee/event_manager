I had a lot of difficulty with this hw assignment, this was probably the trickiest assignment I’ve had bya far if I'm being honest. I watched the instructor video but it was still a little hard to follow. I might just have to go back and rewatch it again. I couldn't figure out the issue demonstrated in the instructor video, however I was able to resolve 5 issues related to key and assertion errors related to the nickname and username related to the project. 
	
However, I could definitely still use a little more practice. Creating and documenting issues wasn’t difficult and was probably one of the easier parts of the project. I can also get some more practice on the openapi and the type of code errors.
